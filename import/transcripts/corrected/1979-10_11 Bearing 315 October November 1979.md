**Greetings,**

_WELCOME TO OUR NEW MEMBERS!!_ The months of August/September saw a great increase in the COC's membership roster, due primarily to:

A. Karl Nolte's excellent series of Orienteering seminars at REI followed by a Beginners' Training Event at Woodland Park.

B. The COC's 7-week Orienteering Display at the Pacific Science Center in conjunction with the Center's Map Exhibit put together by the National Archives.

We invite all new members and those new to Orienteering to our October 13 (note date change) Beginners' meet at Seward Park in Seattle. See you there!

In a more serious vein, many of you are already aware that Corrie and I will be leaving the Seattle area for Cedar Rapids, Iowa on 1 November. We've enjoyed our association with the club and hope to see you all at the October meeting and meet.

## EVENTS

On September 8, Karl Nolte presented a Beginners' Training Event at Woodland Park in Seattle. This event was a 'hands on' finale to Karl's two map-and-compass seminars at REI during August. Karl procured and field-checked a new map of Woodland Park and then used it to put together a 9-point course. Karl's lecture and training series were very positively received and have resulted in a new group of Orienteers in our midst. Thanks to Karl for his efforts.

**BEGINNERS TRAINING EVENT - Woodland Park**

1. Mike Schuh - 27 minutes
2. Berith Larsson - 30
3. Richard Lacey - 35
4. Göran and Robert Larsson - 38
5. Joe Dawson - 58
(plus 11 other finishers)

On September 16, Einar Storakers set up a series of challenging courses in Area 33 at Fort Lewis. This area has become one of the clubs' favorite meet sites due to the rolling terrain and many natural features. Due to the publicity efforts of Len Englund and Celeste Neuffer, we had participants from both the Orienteering Association of British Columbia and the University of Idaho Orienteering Club. The weather was 'patches of clouds, but no rain' and we all participated in excellent orienteering and friendship.

On July 15, the COC held a bon voyage party for Tom and Annette Stewart, in which they were presented with a lifetime membership to the club. We recently received the following note from Tom in Hawaii:

> Dear Members of Cascade Orienteering Club,
>
> I would like to thank you very sincerely for honoring me with the lifetime membership in a great organization. My family and I miss the Pacific Northwest very much, but not nearly as much as we miss the great people associated with it. We really appreciated your warm friendship. To all those who really keep the club going, I will extend every courtesy if you should ever visit Hawaii. The Stewart family fully intends on returning to the Seattle area in the future. We hope to see you all again.
