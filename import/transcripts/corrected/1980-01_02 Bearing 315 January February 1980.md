## COC SHORTS

Don't forget our Annual Meeting on Tuesday, February 11th at 7 PM at the Greenlake Library—easily found overlooking the lake on its east side.

This is THE business meeting of the year for us. The election committee, consisting of Dave Enger, Tony Paulsen, and Charlie Bock, has put together a slate of officers for the general membership's approval; however, nominations will also be accepted from the floor for anyone's favorite candidate nomination. The Yearly Report will be read—a great way to acquaint oneself with the club, and the audit of the books will be reported.

And while you're paying all those December bills, don't forget DUES are DUE.

1. Members who joined before July 1979 (check your membership card if in doubt) owe full dues: $4 single membership and $7 family membership.
2. Non-members who have been receiving the COC newsletter since before July 1979, have dues due in the above amounts if you would like the newsletter to continue being received OR please contact us if you are unable to pay or belong to a non-profit group on our mailing list.

Cash, money order, check, your wedding band, gold tooth inlays... are all acceptable ways of paying your dues. Simply slip your payment into an envelope or carton and mail to your favorite club at: COC, Box 3572, Bellevue, WA 98009.
