The Club's first regional meet (the 1st Annual Lingering Lodestone & Compass Carnival) held on May 21, became an international event with visitors from Canada and Swedish exchange students competing. The meet was very well run and everyone had a good time. Many people took the time to compete on more than one course. This can really help increase skills as the competitor is more aware of mistakes the second time around and can concentrate on corrective procedures.

Prizes were awarded by our co-sponsor Recreational Equipment Co-op. These folks did a tremendous job in helping set up the event and we hope to work with them again at a future event. Our thanks also went out to the Weyerhaeuser Company on whose property the meet was held. Many of us now have a better understanding of what "reforested land" is like.

One thing we are learning from all our meets is our need for better maps. We hope to work on this during the summer.

At our June 12th meeting, a decision was reached regarding our monthly meetings. From now on, our meetings will be for business and planning only. No workshops or instruction will be included at these meetings. They will be held at the Puget Power Building Auditorium in Bellevue - 10608 N.E. 4th. All members are welcome to come and help in the running of the Club, but as the Club grows and events increase, we need a regular time and place to lay plans and discuss the reactions to our activities. Outdoor events will be monthly, and it is our hope to get more members involved in their operation.

Membership in Cascade Orienteering Club is $4.00 for an individual and $7.00 for a family. Members receive all mailings and will get a discount in the entry fee at all meets.

The Orienteering Association of B.C. schedules many orienteering meets throughout the year. Some of our members have gone to these meets and find them very well run and a lot of fun. Their next big meet is a "team" competition on July 8 and 9. This will be a camp-out weekend competition which is quite long - 36 and 25 miles. Entry fee is $8.00 per team and payable before June 25. Write or call:
