# BEARING 315

**January/February 1978**  
*Volume 1, Number 1*

## FROM THE PRESIDENT

Last spring, I saw a short article, actually a clipping in the locker room where I run, that said there was to be a meeting for Orienteering. Ever since then, I've been pitching in to get our club off the ground. Finally, we're off!

All of you receiving this mailing have shown some interest in Orienteering, at one time or another. Most of you would like to find out more, yet are confused as to when we meet, etc. Do not despair... Come to the Puget Power Auditorium, in Bellevue, on the second Monday of each month (next meeting is on January 9, 1978). First, we discuss club business and talk Orienteering – giving pointers, discussing past events, and getting ourselves generally hyped-up on ORIENTEERING.

"What's to get hyped-up about?" you ask as you shake your head. --- You know, I can't quite describe it, but when you finally see that Red/White Control Marker hanging from a tree, especially if you do it "technically correct", you'll be able to feel what I mean. And you can have this opportunity January 14th at Seward Park, in Seattle.

See you then.

## COMING EVENTS

On Saturday, January 14th, we will be holding our first event of the year – a SCORE ORIENTEERING MEET. It will be held in Seward Park, a surprisingly full area in such a compact peninsula. Meet at the picnic buildings near the upper parking lot. A workshop will be held prior to the event to help those who are unfamiliar with using a compass. Compasses will be available for a 50 cent rental fee, each.

Don't miss our second big event to be held at Fort Lewis, Area 10 on Saturday, February 4. An exciting course has been laid out by Tom Stewart. You will have your choice of running the novice (white) or the intermediate (orange) courses. We will discuss car pools at the business meeting on January 9th.

### SCORE ORIENTEERING

In a SCORE ORIENTEERING EVENT, the area chosen for competition is covered with a large number of Control Points. The Control Points are weighted, according to the difficulty anticipated in finding them. Points are selected for both the novice and the experienced Orienteer. This event requires the competitors to locate as many Control Markers as possible within the one-hour period. Points are awarded for each Control Point found, and deducted for being on the course for more than an hour. Competitors are given a map of the area and sent out at two (2) minute intervals. The map shows each control point and its point value. Choose the route you feel is best for you. A good event is one that has all the Control Points found, but having no one person finding them all within the allotted time.

## IN THE BEGINNING

The CASCADE ORIENTEERING CLUB was officially begun at a meeting at the Puget Power Auditorium in November, 1977. Those present elected the following club interim officers:

| Title          | Name            | Location       |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| PRESIDENT      | Gregg Ferry     | Everett, WA    |
| VICE-PRESIDENT | Stanley Hochman | Bellevue, WA   |
| SEC./TREAS.    | Tom Stewart     | Fort Lewis, WA |

Chairpersons appointed by the officers:

| Role       | Name            | Location    |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Membership | Celeste Neuffer | Seattle, WA |
| Events     | Len Englund     | Bellevue, WA |

Meetings were selected to be held on each second Monday of each month. A charter was applied for from the US ORIENTEERING FEDERATION and was granted prior to the following meeting.

At the second meeting, a dues structure was discussed. A $4 for individual and $7 family rate was approved.

We have a lot of ground to cover to become a solid club. Come out and join us at the meets. If you feel like adding to your store of knowledge, help us or set up a meet.
