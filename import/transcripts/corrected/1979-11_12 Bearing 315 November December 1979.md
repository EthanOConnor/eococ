## From the Vice-President

At the Oct. meeting, Rob Corkran gave an interesting talk on Scandinavian Orienteering and showed us some of their maps. They lack topographical slashes to indicate downhill slopes but are done in the international four-color system. The green for vegetation varies from dark (impossible to walk through), to medium green (difficult to run through), to light green (runable) to yellow (meadow). There was marked interest from everyone present in the maps. To print this type of map here would be an initial colored proof cost of $60.00. The possibility of increasing the dues and/or meet fees to cover the colored maps will be discussed at the Feb. annual meeting.

In Nov, Mike and Corrie Fiedler moved to Cedar Rapids, Iowa. They were two of the more active and enthusiastic members of our COC and we will greatly miss them. With the possibility of internationally colored orienteering maps to soon(?) become a reality, they left us with a most generous monetary gift towards that end. Thanks again.

## Dues

Those of you who joined the club before July 1979 have dues due in Jan. for the coming year. Membership fees are $4.00 for a single member and $7.00 for a family. Mail early or see Dave in December.

## Meetings

On Monday, Dec. 10th at the Greenlake Library:

- 7:00 pm: Orienteering talk for new members
- 7:30 pm: Business meeting
- A short talk by Goran Larsson on "Map Making and International Colors and Symbols" are planned

A little background on Goran... Goran started the sport of orienteering at 14 years of age in Sweden, about 15 years ago. He taught it for 8 years and was an elite team coach for 2 years. In the latter capacity, he was responsible for his team's diet, five-day-a-week training, and keeping them in fit shape (10,000m runs in less than 32 minutes). The teams compete every weekend from spring to fall, and all on a volunteer basis. Now the good news: less than 10% of those participating in orienteering in Sweden do so on teams, most do it as recreation.

## Event Results

On Oct. 13th, Corrie and Mike Fiedler set three courses at Seward Park, one being a Score Orienteering Meet, i.e., as many points in 60 minutes as possible. Karl Nolte drew up the improved map of Seward that now contains all the paths. Great map, Karl!
