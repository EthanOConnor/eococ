# BEARING 315

_Newsletter of the Cascade Orienteering Club_
### SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 1980

Come on out to the meet of the season, a Class B Regional Meet at Fort Lewis on Sunday, October 5. There will be prizes!

Clayton Smith, club member, has made a new 5-color map of the Burns Woods area of Fort Lewis. This will be the first meet run on that map. It should be fun, rain or shine.

**TERRAIN**: Very runable, quite flat prairie with open forests and large grassy areas. Crisscrossed by several dirt roads.

**COURSES AND CLASSES**: White, Orange, Red, and Blue courses with men's and women's competitive and recreational classes on each course. These provide suitable choices for all participants, whether you are a novice or an experienced orienteer. In addition, club members will be available for instruction in the use of map and compass at the beginning of the meet (anytime from 9:30 - 12:00).

**COST**: Club members will pay $2.00 per map. Non-members will pay $3.00. Pairs or groups participating on the same map and course may share the same map and will pay only one fee. 

It is best to bring your own compass because our supply of rental compasses is small. However, if you don't have a compass, come anyway and we will rent you one for 50c.

**PRIZES**:

- Cascade Orienteering Club memberships.
- United States Orienteering Federation memberships.
- Cascade Orienteering Club T-shirts.

**REGISTRATION**: Registration will be from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and the first start will be at 10 a.m. There is no pre-registration by mail.

**FACILITIES**: There are no toilets and no running water available at the site. The Club will provide a minimal amount of liquid refreshments but it is advisable to bring your own picnic lunch and drink.

**TO GET THERE**: Burns Woods is on the east side of Hwy 507, approximately 2.5 miles north of Roy. The approach from the north is as follows: take exit 127 off Interstate 5, head east on Hwy 512 for 2 miles, then exit onto Hwy 7 southbound toward Mt. Rainier. After 5 miles turn right onto Hwy 507 and continue for 5 miles to the red and white orienteering signs indicating a left turn into the site.
