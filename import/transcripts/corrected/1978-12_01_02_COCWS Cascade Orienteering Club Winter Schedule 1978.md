**FROM THE EDITOR**

As we start another year (our second), it's time for us to get out our club newsletter. We've had a busy and frustrating Summer, with lots of meets and very little attendance. We are hoping that the three-month schedule meets with your interest. I am looking forward to seeing you at our meets, and meeting more of you. This is really the best time of year for Orienteering.

- Stanley Hochman

**FROM THE PRESIDENT**

The Club's meetings are open to all members. Recently we have had no one attend except for a couple of the officers. This is your club and we need your ideas and opinions in order to provide you with the events you enjoy. The Club cannot function without volunteers willing to take on responsibility for meets and/or training. And it's the best way to learn the skills of Orienteering. You will be contacted in the coming months to ask for help in the year ahead. We will need a new President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, and coordinators for Events, Publicity, Membership, and Training. Enough said.

Dues are due for all members who joined before June 31, 1978.

Tom Stewart has a super course laid out for the December 16 meet. One for the Novice and one for you super Orienteers. See you at the Fort.
