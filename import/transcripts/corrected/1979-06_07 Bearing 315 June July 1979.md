**Greetings,**  
Orienteering has been growing by leaps and bounds in the Pacific Northwest. Although the Cascade Orienteering Club was formally organized less than two years ago, we now have 60 members (and growing) and are able to sponsor year-round Orienteering in the Seattle-Tacoma area.

Strangely enough, the last two years have shown that it is difficult to maintain interest and enthusiasm in COC-sponsored events over the summer months. I hope this year will be an exception, as we have planned a series of excellent Orienteering meets and publicity/training events through the summer quarter.

Take a look at the coming events and plan ahead to make Orienteering a part of your summer plans.

## EVENTS
Tom Stewart was the meet director for a meet held 12 May at Ft. Lewis in Area 32. Nice weather was on hand for an enjoyable walk through the woods. The enthusiasm of the O'Brian Family and Devmurti Khalsa set the pace for the white and yellow courses, respectively. Devmurti, a first-time Orienteer, did exceptionally well. Gil Andrew and his Scouts also added greatly to the atmosphere of the event. The Wishart's and Dave O'Brian were so enthusiastic that they finished the White Course, then started on the Yellow Course.

Tom Stewart was meet director for another great Ft. Lewis meet on 16 June. Although rain was forecast, the sun shone most of the morning. The highlight of the meet were the great picnic lunches enjoyed over good conversation after the participants returned.

**COC MEETINGS**  
Four major changes have been recently made regarding COC business meetings.

1. Meetings are now held every other month, rather than monthly (June, August, October, December)
2. Meetings are held at the Greenlake Library (in the basement, easy to find) rather than in Bellevue.
3. Meetings are preceded with a half-hour 'introduction to Orienteering' for newcomers.
4. Meetings will befollowed by a short film whenever possible.

In June, all four of the above changes were in effect, and we had a great meeting. Both the training session and the business meeting were very well attended, and we all enjoyed the film 'Coping With Life on the Run' with Dr. George Sheehan (Runner's World) supplied by Karl Nolte.

**June Meeting Highlights:**

- Boy Scout Troop 367 will be invited to join the COC with one family membership
- Meets have been scheduled and meet directors organized for meets through September.
- ByLaws are in the process of being revised. All suggested revisions were presented to the club.

**TRAINING TIPS**  
I've noticed many people expending a considerable amount of time measuring the distance between two points and then comparing the map distance in centimeters or inches with the scale on the map. An easy way to accomplish distance measuring is to place masking tape along the measuring edge of your compass before attending any event. When you get your hands on the map to be used for the event, simply use a pen to directly transcribe the meter bar scale on the map to the masking tape on your compass. Thus, you can instantly measure distance between points without referring to the map bar scale and chancing an error in measurement.

**BYLAW REVISIONS**  
The Cascade Orienteering Club bylaws have been in effect for over a year now. They have served us well, giving order to the somewhat chaotic formation of a new club. The time has come, however, to propose a few revisions for the following reasons:

1. The club, out of necessity, cannot follow certain provisions (i.e., the nominating committee could not find two nominees for each COC office last February).
2. Some provisions seem somewhat severe for a small club (i.e., all officers must be paid members of USOF, and married members may not both hold office at the same time).

Therefore, I presented the following revisions at the May executive meeting and at the June business meeting. We will put them to a vote at the August business meeting. (Under our present bylaws, that is the proper way to present bylaw revisions).

1. ARTICLE III (Membership) Section 2:  
   ELIMINATE:  
   'and be eligible to hold office after one year of membership. This requirement is to be waived for the first 24 months of this club's existence.'  
2. ARTICLE IV (Officers) Section 1:  
   CHANGE:  
   'These officers shall be members in good standing of the U.S. Orienteering Federation and shall perform the duties prescribed by these bylaws...'  
   TO:  
   'The President shall be a member in good standing of the U.S. Orienteering Federation and all officers shall perform the duties prescribed by these bylaws...'
3. ARTICLE IV (Officers) Section 2:  
   CHANGE:  
   'The duty of this committee is to nominate at least two candidates for the offices to be filled.'  
   TO:  
   'The duty of this committee is to nominate candidates for the offices to be filled.'
4. ARTICLE IV (Officers) Section 2:  
   ELIMINATE:  
   '...if submitted to the secretary in writing. This petition must be signed by five (5) members in good standing, and be presented to the secretary at least two (2) weeks prior to the election at the annual meeting in February.'
5. ARTICLE IV (Officers) Section 4:  
   ELIMINATE:  
   'No member shall be eligible to serve more than two consecutive terms in the same office.'
6. ARTICLE VII (Committees) Section 2:  
   CHANGE:  
   'A Membership Committee composed of two (2) members shall be appointed.'  
   TO:  
   'A Membership Coordinator shall be appointed.'
7. ARTICLE VII (Committees) Section 3:  
   CHANGE:  
   'A Publicity Committee shall be appointed.'  
   TO:  
   'A Publicity Coordinator shall be appointed.'

## FOR BEGINNERS

Every month, the officers of the COC get a number of calls from people who have read or heard about the sport of Orienteering and are interested in learning more. The COC is especially committed to teaching the sport of Orienteering to these newcomers. To this end, we sponsor several map-and-compass training events throughout the year and also hold short 'introduction to orienteering' talks before each COC business meeting. However, since the best way to learn Orienteering is to Orienteer, we welcome novices to all COC meets. Just let us know that you are a new Orienteer, and we'll spend as long as you need going over map-and-compass skills. Then a COC member will go with you to the first few points until you get the hang of it. We'll see you at the next meet!

**Q. What equipment do I need to Orienteer?**  
A. For the first time or two, you'll probably want to wear outdoors/hiking type clothes, with either tennis shoes or boots. Bring along a clipboard or sheet of cardboard to support your map, and a pencil. The COC rents compasses for a quarter, so don't worry about that.

**Q. What sort of people Orienteer?**  
A. One of the Orienteering mottos is 'Orienteering is for everyone.' A typical COC meet will find Boy Scouts out in teams of two, husband-and-wife teams out for a walk in the woods, and competitive Orienteers who plan on running the 4-6 mile course.

## COC SHORTS

- Rumor has it that Golden Grahams breakfast cereal (in conjunction with Silva) is sponsoring an Orienteering offer (send in a box-top, and they will send you a compass, Orienteering info, etc.). If you learn more about it, let us know.
- A red Boy-Scout type canteen was found after the May 12 Ft. Lewis event. Give Mike a call if it's yours.
