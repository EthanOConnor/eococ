This issue has our updated schedule through October of this year. A couple of words on coming events. First; our picnic is next month (August) at Lake Kachees. The regional meet we had been thinking about has been tabled until next year, but we will have a meet near Hyak Ski Area instead. Einar Svensson will put this one together in the high country above the ski tow area.

We will also be participating in a couple of "Fairs" in the coming months and will be presenting the sport of Orienteering to the general public. The "Environmental Faire" in October will take the place of an outdoor event. I hope some of you who would like to "talk up" our sport will let me know so we can give you an opportunity in planning and "manning" our booth. Plans are being formulated now, and I hope a lot of you will compete in this event, as you won't get wet!

Linda Lengacher has had a story and series of pictures of our regional meet in May accepted by the _Seattle Times_. She informed me that the story will run in the Sunday Supplement some time in August or September. GOOD WORK!

I would also like to welcome four new members to our club this month:

- Bill Malden
- Robert Becker
- Charles Bock
- Gordon Legg

See you at the next meet!

Finally, at our last meeting on July 17th, we decided that the Newsletter will be issued regularly 4 times a year, after each planning session, and supplemental issues mailed between if needed. With our membership growing (almost 60) and our "interested" list expanding as well, the cost of maintaining a monthly or bi-monthly mailing schedule has become prohibitive. We will, however, try to enlarge the regular issues. Any ideas??

## MEETS

The weather has been great for our last two meets - great for Orienteering, that is. On July 24th, Len Englund laid out two courses at Fort Lewis. Then on July 15th, Karl Nolte held a short mapping practice session before releasing about a dozen competitors loose on a course in Discovery Park, Seattle. Attendance has been sparse the last two meets, but those who attended had a lot of fun and sharpened their skills as well.
