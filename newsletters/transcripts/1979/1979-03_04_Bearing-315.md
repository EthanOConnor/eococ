**Greetings,**

February/March 1979 have been extraordinary months for the sport of ORIENTEERING in Western Washington. The Cascade Orienteering Club (COC) held two successful training workshop/meets and a fantastic intermediate meet, all of which were well attended. The club's membership roster and treasury are growing and we are receiving some good press coverage. Nearly every day we receive a call or two from prospective orienteers wishing to know more about the sport. To keep the club functioning at a high level of activity, we'll need some help. Addressing newsletters, publicity work, map field checks, training seminars – these are only a few of the jobs on our list. When you have a free evening or only an hour or two, give me a call (322 9018). With your help, the COC will continue in its growth toward an exciting, active club.

## EVENTS

The COC sponsored two training meets and an intermediate event during the months of February/March. Although the weather conditions ranged from perfect to somewhat less than perfect, enthusiasm prevailed and all meets were enjoyable, learning experiences.

**A. Discovery Park - February 24**  
_Meet Directors: Mike Sherman and Corrie Fiedler_

Participants in this COC-sponsored Map and Compass training course spent about an hour in the Discovery Park visitors' center, learning the basics of compass use and Novice orienteering technique. The classroom work was followed by a short (0.8 km, 5 control) course in the southeast corner of the park; Mike had obtained and extensively field-corrected the meet map. This excellent, although small-scale (1:2500), map of Discovery Park will be useful for future training events held in the park.

**B. Fort Lewis - February 25**  
_Meet Director: Tom Stewart_

Tom held this novice meet in the Lake Chambers area of Ft. Lewis in conjunction with an Orienteering seminar presented at PLU and sponsored by the President's Council on Physical Fitness. The 5.4 km, 11 control course began with several straightforward control points, then progressed to more difficult clues and geographic locations as the novice orienteers became more confident. Once again it was shown that 'orienteering is for everyone' as Richard Broelser finished the course with his 4 (count them four) children ages 3-8 years old.

**C. Ft. Lewis Area CTA-A - March 18**  
_Meet Director: Tom Stewart_

Tom organized the most successful meet in the COC's history at a new Ft. Lewis area near the town of Steilacoom. Nearly 30 orienteers (including children) finished the 3.9 km, 9 control novice course, or the 5.1 km, 10 control red (intermediate) course. The weather was beautiful, the courses were challenging, and the socializing was a lot of fun.

**COC Meetings**

The Cascade Orienteering Club held its March monthly meeting on 12 March at the Puget Power Building, Bellevue. Attendance was good (including several newcomers) and we covered a lot of ground. Major actions and changes in the COC are as follows:

1. The club will now meet on a (modified) bimonthly schedule. Meetings will continue to be on the second Monday, but on alternate months, the next meetings are scheduled for April, June, and August.
2. The meeting place has been moved to west of Lake Washington. Starting with the June 11 COC club meeting, we will meet in the basement meeting room of the Greenlake Library.
3. The COC has ordered another 2 dozen club T-shirts to replenish our supply of small and medium sizes. We will sell them for $4.00 each at club events.
4. A new publicity flier has been prepared and is being distributed through sports shops and on college bulletin boards throughout the area.
5. We have received several opportunities to help Scout troops and other youth groups learn map-and-compass. Tom Stewart (chairman of the Training committee) reported that the club is ready and able to help in any way possible.
6. The two training workshops held during the month of February were very successful and introduced 50+ people to the sport of Orienteering. Plans were made to continue training events, with a map-and-compass workshop to be held in May in Discovery Park.
7. The office of Secretary in the COC is still open and help is badly needed with the newsletter and meeting minute taking.

COC meetings are open to everyone and we especially appreciate seeing newcomers to the sport of Orienteering. Join us April 9 at the Puget Power Building in Bellevue at 7 pm for a short map-and-compass course followed by the club meeting at 7:30 pm.

**Training Tips**

Because I have recently mentioned a few things I have done with orienteering that surprised some people (Mike Sherman), I have decided to share whenever possible some tips on the sport with everyone involved.

**Tip 1:**  
After you complete an orienteering event, save your course map. When you do your 'post-mortem' of your mistakes or good points, trace your exact route in a distinctive color directly onto the map. In this way, you'll develop a file on how you run an event. You may see certain patterns developing - some good and some bad. At least in this way, you'll be able to see the patterns and deal with them as necessary.

_Tom Stewart_

(Tom is a great source of information and enthusiasm to the COC on all aspects of orienteering, both as a meet participant and as a meet director. Tom will be leaving Washington State in July for several years duty in Hawaii with the U.S. Army. Each member of COC might make an effort to spend a few minutes with Tom before he leaves to learn a few tricks from his vast knowledge of the sport of orienteering.)

**For Beginners**

The COC is a growing club and we are especially committed to teaching others the skills of map-and-compass use and the sport of Orienteering. At every COC meet, several people are available to help beginners with Orienteering skills and to accompany them through the first few control points.

If you are new to Orienteering, you may be interested in the following information:

**Q.** How do I learn to Orienteer?  
**A.** Come to the COC map-and-compass workshop at Discovery Park in May (see coming events) or just come to any COC orienteering event. It's an easy sport to learn.

**Q.** Do I need an expensive compass?  
**A.** No, COC rents compasses for 25¢ at all meets and workshops. If you wish to purchase a compass, the Silva "Starter 1-2-3" is available for $3.00 and the Silva Polaris 7 for $4.00 in many sporting goods stores.

**Q.** Do I need to be an active runner or in excellent physical shape to Orienteer?  
**A.** No, Orienteering is for everyone. Many participants in COC's meet walk through the course and enjoy the fresh air and scenery. Others come as a family and enjoy the outdoors together while the children learn map-and-compass skills. Of course, Orienteering can also be a competitive sport and we have several members who enjoy running the course for the best times.

**Q.** Do I need to join the Cascade Orienteering Club to participate in the meets?  
**A.** No, usually there is a small extra charge for non-COC members, but everyone is welcome to come, participate, and learn at COC's meets. (Typical meet charges are 50¢-$1.50 for COC members and $1.00-$2.00 for non-members.)

**COC Shorts**

- A compass was found after the March 18 meet at Ft. Lewis. Call Mike at 322-9018 and identify it and it's yours.
- Thanks to the Hendricksons for the donation of the meet first aid kit.

## MAPPING
Two maps were added to the COC's collection over the last months. Mike Sherman extensively field checked and corrected an old Army map of the SW corner of Discovery Park. Tom Stewart did substantial correction and field work in his preparation of the CTA_A map for the Ft. Lewis meet.
