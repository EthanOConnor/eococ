**Greetings,**

We are well into a great spring season of ORIENTEERING in Western Washington. The Cascade Orienteering Club (COC) was active during March/April, holding two meets (Ft. Lewis Area CIA and Seward Park), a short workshop (prior to the April meeting), and training two groups of Scouts and a group of Boys Club participants in map-and-compass techniques. We have a full summer of Orienteering planned, and we're hoping that the Club's enthusiasm of the last few months will continue.

## EVENTS

Len Englund was meet director for the April 21 meet at Seward Park in Seattle. We were somewhat unprepared for the large turnout, but after a late start, we all had a great time on Len's excellent courses. Mike Sherman trained a troop of Boy Scouts and a troop of Cub Scouts in the use of map-and-compass and then the Scouts ran the Novice course in small groups (posting good times). The weather was beautiful, and we learned again how fun Orienteering can be, even close to home.

## COC SHORTS

**April meeting highlights:**

- Publicity flyers are being distributed to most area sporting shops, and we're getting a great response.
- COC is going to participate in the Eddie Bauer Outdoor Awareness Fair and the REI Thursday lectures during the summer.
- Our COC Regional Meet is well into the planning stages; circle Sept 16 on your calendar.
- The club membership is growing in leaps and bounds, due in part to the recent article in Pacific Search magazine and continuing publicity in the Times, PI, Sun, and SeattleSport (plus an article in the Everett paper).
- Tom Stewart was elected a permanent member of COC.

## FOR BEGINNERS

The Cascade Orienteering Club is especially committed to teaching the sport of Orienteering to newcomers to the sport. We welcome novice orienteers to all COC sponsored events, we usually prepare a novice course (1-3 km) at each meet, and COC members are always available to give map-and-compass training and to help newcomers on the first few Novice control points. If you are new to Orienteering, you may be interested in the following information:

**Q. If I've never participated in an Orienteering meet before, how do I learn?**  
**A.** All COC meets have a Novice course; just show up at the meet and tell the person at the sign-in-table that you are new. You will be able to sit down for a few minutes with an experienced orienteer who will explain the basics of the sport and get you started on the course. If you are interested in a more detailed explanation, join us at the June map-and-compass workshop (for beginners) or the short workshop prior to the June COC meeting (see coming events).

**Q. What sort of people belong and participate in the COC meets?**  
**A.** There is no typical orienteer. The COC has some participants who enjoy running the course for time, but in addition, many families and couples enjoy walking the course to learn more about map-and-compass and to be in the outdoors. Children ages 10-14 can usually do well in teams of two on the Novice course, while older teenagers go out alone on the Novice or Intermediate Courses. Orienteering is for everyone!

**Q. What do I wear and bring to a meet?**  
**A.** If you are going out alone or with a group to walk the course, typical hiking clothes with either tennis shoes or boots are fine. For the first meet or two, you will probably want to rent a compass from the COC ($0.25) before investing $4-6 on an orienteering compass.
