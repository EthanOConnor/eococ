<figcaption>The BC Championship at Brandywine Falls, near Vancouver, was well attended by members of COC to the tune of about seventeen. The meet was a two-day event on September 6 and 7 in a runnable open forest, which as most of us know is not too common on the west coast. This photo is of some of the COC members who were there, are you in the picture?</figcaption>

## COC Members at US Championships

Open forest with little underbrush, rolling hills, and good runnable surfaces with few rocks characterized the terrain at the 1980 national championship orienteering meet. About 450 participants from all over the U.S. and several foreign countries attended. The autumn colors, cool but sunny weather, well-organized events, and enthusiastic orienteers combined for a wonderful weekend.

Goran and Berith Larsson with their son Robert, Bill Hall, and Dave Enger all made the trip from Seattle to the St. Louis area. Goran, Bill, and Dave ran the blue course along with about 51 other men. Goran placed 5th and Dave placed 28th, while Bill had some difficulty with the challenging courses, especially the first day. Berith placed very well on the red course.

Dieter Wolf, a world-class orienteer from Switzerland, easily won the men's (H21A-blue) competition. Eric Weyman of the Ramapo (New Jersey) O Club placed second and was declared the new U.S. men's champion. Peter Gagarin, the former and longtime champion, was 3rd. West coast competitors made a better showing this year with Dennis Holleran of Oregon in 4th, Goran in 5th, and Bruce Wolfe of the San Francisco Bay Area O Club in 7th place. Sharon Crawford of the New England O Club easily won the D19A-red course competition to retain her long-standing status as U.S. national women's champion.

Many of you remember Mike and Corrie Piedler, last year's Cascade O Club president and secretary who now live in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. They both ran the orange course, with Mike winning the H21C competition. Mike and Corrie belong to the Minnesota O Club, although because of busy schedules and long distances they are able to attend only a few events. We all enjoyed seeing each other again, but the weekend ended too soon.

## From the President

I'd like to make a pitch for the United States Orienteering Federation (USOF). The stated objective of USOF is "to promote and support Orienteering in the United States of America and internationally." USOF serves as the national clearinghouse for orienteering information and is a liaison with the International Orienteering Federation (IOF). USOF charters and assists local clubs, provides materials and expertise, as well as coordinates and sanctions national events such as the Reno class A meet in April and last month's national championship meet.

The Cascade Orienteering Club is USOF chartered, and several of us have individual or family USOF memberships. Almost anyone may support the sport by joining USOF. Benefits of membership include receiving the monthly magazine Orienteering USA, which contains many helpful mapping and competition tips as well as information on the national scene. For more information on USOF membership, [ask] me, Mike Schuh or Clayton Smith (474-5675, Tacoma).

## NEW MAPS

Several mapping projects are underway or will commence soon, Mapping is a very good way to improve your map reading skills and your help is invited. If you would like to lend your talents on any of the following maps, just give the person in charge a call.

|Map|Contact|Phone|

COC is always looking for new areas for orienteering, especially large ones that may be used year round. If you know of any likely locations - anywhere in the state with about 300 acres or more - please bring them to the attention of Goran (Clayton in Tacoma) or any other officer or meet director.

## Editorial Comment
With the help of some articles from Dave and Mike this issue has grown by one page. Some of the meet results and those articles by Mike were done on his word processor and were sent to me photo ready — this newsletter is going places, why not be a part of it. Thanks Mike and Dave, I welcome any material for the newsletter. How do you like the photos? If you have any Black and White photos of any of our events consider sending them in to the newsletter and share them with us — I will ensure that any photos sent in for printing will be returned the same way you sent them. I am looking forward to the next issue which will contain an article about our planned class A meet next year near Cle Elum.

Yours in orienteering

## MEET RESULTS

### Clubs

COC - Cascade O Club
EOC - Ellensburg O Club
NSO - North Shore Orienteers (BC)
OUBC - Orienteering UBC

### Seward Park
#### October 26, 1980

Mike Schuh and Debbie Newell directed a well-attended meet in Seward Park on October 26. Three courses were set, including a technically challenging orange that might have been deserving of being called a green course. Thanks go to Jean Davis, Dave Enger, the Larssons, and others for their help.

One minor problem developed when one competitor began to copy his course onto his map before being given a start time, much less having been officially started. This caused no real problem but everyone is reminded that besides being a bit unfair, it is adequate grounds for disqualification in sanctioned events.

### Stevens Pass

Gary MacDonald and Mike Schuh presented a brief workshop and set a short course for a Pacific Northwest Professional Ski Patrol Association training weekend at Stevens Pass on a sunny October 19. Though poorly attended because of its place on the agenda (last), the event was enjoyed by all who participated. The Stevens Pass ski area is a possible site for future club meets in late summer or early autumn.

## Some Thoughts on Making and Reading Maps

Besides being a great favor to other orienteers in your area, making an O map can really improve your orienteering. If you've made maps, you know what I mean; for those who haven't, let me try to explain.

All maps are fallible - they all have errors and omissions. Some are better than others, some a lot better, but all have mistakes. The mistakes occur for two reasons even on good maps: 1) They're made by humans, and we have a knack for doing imperfect jobs. In the process of field checking, redrawing, and printing, it's remarkably easy to leave something off, or say, interpret a speck of dirt as a boulder. 2) Map making is very subjective, for example: how do you map a marsh that is flooded (and looks very "uncrossable") one day during a rainstorm, but is almost dry when you go by it a day later?

So the map you end up using represents one person's interpretation (or several persons' different interpretations) of the terrain, for those parts of the map they actually field-checked and accurately drafted. And then there are those areas or whole maps that haven't been field checked! This may sound pretty discouraging, but it shouldn't. If you are aware of the possible problems a map, any map, can have, then you can deal with them. There are several ways to do this.

First, when competing on a new map, start judging its accuracy as soon as you can - before your start time if maps are given out early. Examine the terrain and the map from a map maker's point of view. Are the trails near the start/finish correct, what size boulders (if any) are mapped, do the contours look right or are they very generalized, and so on? Sometimes part may be good and part bad - the trails may be just right, but the contours terrible. Figure out how much you can rely on the map, or how little. Since it normally takes a leg or two on a course to do this, that's a good reason to take the first couple of legs carefully. (Beginning to see where some map making experience can improve your orienteering?)

Second, never rely on just one feature on the map for your navigation - even on an excellent map, it may be the one item in a thousand that got misdrawn. (Likewise, you never use just a compass, or just pace-counting) Always have two or three safety checks to make sure you're going the right way - other features on the map that you will notice as you go by them, as well as rough compass and pace checks. It doesn't take much more effort or time, and if you do go the wrong way, you will realize it a lot sooner and can correct yourself with little loss of time.

Third, if it's a lousy map, you can still orienteer. It's just more important to use your compass and your pace-count and still get what you can out of the map. For example, if the trails are not accurate, don't just look for, say the second trail on the left. Look instead for, say the second trail on the left in about 400 meters that goes sharply uphill to the northeast. If the second left comes in 150 meters and goes downhill to the southeast, then you won't just follow it blindly. Rather, you'll stay on course and make a mental note of another trail that wasn't on the map. Remember - good map or bad, it's the same for everyone.

Finally, if you've made a map and realize how much time and effort goes into it, you'll be a lot less eager to criticize anyone else's efforts.

## Symbols for a Black and White Orienteering Map

Robin Harvey, in his book *Map Making for Orienteers*, compiled this list of symbols for new mappers to use when they want to try a simple black and white map and, at the same time, attempt to achieve the quality found in color map symbols. With the absence of color, the difference between symbols must be shown with line thickness and the pattern used. For the time being, we will overlook line thickness because most beginning mappers do not have technical pens available to them or wish to purchase them. (Mappers who would like to maintain Harvey's recommended standard in line thickness can talk with me for more information.) A quick look at the list will show that there are fewer symbols than what is used on a color map. This is necessary to avoid confusion between similar color symbols and, at the same time, keep the map easy to read in the absence of color.

For example, a black dotted line is used exclusively for water features (streams and ditches) on a black and white map to avoid confusion with contour lines or a road. A mapper must keep in mind that an orienteer's route selection is based on the information provided on the map. It must not only be accurate but legible as well.

## COC to Host Class A Meet

Way back in April, six COC members went to a class A meet in Reno. It was an enjoyable time and many new friendships were made. There were a few problems, however. A marker common to the red and blue courses was hung incorrectly on the first day and a poorly mapped area was used on blue on the second day. This was quite unfortunate as some individuals, like the Larssons, would have been nationally ranked this year if these days had not been voided.

Writing in the May-June Bay Area Orienteering Club newsletter, Joe Scarborough, BAOC President, observes:

> "There is a lesson to be learned here. The West Coast clubs have not yet developed the manpower and expertise to put on a meet without major errors. The result is some very disappointed orienteers who have traveled a long way. Why not wait until we have enough experienced people in the West willing to put in the time required to stage a successful class A meet?"

Well, COC accepts the challenge. Work has begun on a class A meet tentatively to be held next October 3-4 near Cle Elum. Class A meets differ from the class B meets COC has hosted this year in two significant ways: 1) they carry national ranking points and 2) they have fairly strict requirements which must be met before the US Orienteering Federation will sanction them as class A (this last consideration is the reason for rescheduling the meet from April to next October - a lot of fieldwork is required to produce a top-quality map).

There will be plenty of opportunity for volunteer work before and during the meet. Help is needed with publicity, registration, timing, fundraising, mapmaking, and other tasks. Some, like timing, will not be needed until the meet itself, while others (like mapmaking and fundraising) will be needed this winter or next spring. To gain more experience, four class B meets are planned between now and next fall. Everyone is encouraged to help run one or two of them - Cascade is a strong club and getting better.

### Compass Momentos
Why should I
A normally sane and sensible guy
Suddenly Fly
Into the trees
And crawl for miles on hands and knees!
   and Quo Vadis
I'm not sure whether I'm past it,
    or whether I still haven't come to it yet.
