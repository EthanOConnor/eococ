This is THE BIG EVENT. It is the culmination of the COC-Eddie Bauer Fun Trek '80 effort. We will have white, yellow, orange, and red courses, with recreational & competitive categories for each course. The start will be in the picnic area at the top of the hill in Seward Park. The park is on the south portion of Lake Washington in Seattle. Metro bus lines #31 & #10 service it. People may begin anytime between 10 AM and 3 PM. Courses will close at 5 PM.

Pre-registration for non-COC members will be at the Eddie Bauer stores in Seattle & Bellevue, or may be mailed to the Club. A non-member fee of $3 will be charged. Members will pay $2. Registration will also be held at the meet on May 31.

All finishers who successfully complete a course will receive an Eddie Bauer T-shirt and a certificate.

* Recreational category is intended for novices – those who have attended only 1 or 2 meets.
* Competitive category is intended for experienced orienteers who feel confident in their map & compass skills.

We will be using a new, very detailed 1:5000, 4-color, 2.5-meter contour orienteering map of Seward Park prepared by Charlie Bock. Charlie will design the courses, and Dave Enger will be the Meet Director.

All club members are invited, especially those who have helped with Fun Trek '80. It will be a barbecue. Please bring your own food (i.e., hamburger, hot dogs, steak, buns, salad, chips, etc.).

### Special Feature

At several of the past business meetings, Göran Larsson has given marvelous short talks to our membership on International Map Symbols and Colors. Thus, continuing what Göran has begun, enclosed within this newsletter is an expanded form of the symbols and descriptions as used by the International Orienteering Federation in all of its national and international meets. PLEASE SAVE THE IOF SYMBOL SHEET, as it will not be mailed in other newsletters. This month, the explanations have been enclosed, and next month, various clue sheets from IOF Championships will be included to try your luck at them—the answers will also be given! This is all in preparation so that our club can begin using them at meets.
