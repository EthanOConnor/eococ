## A Message from the President

1980 is becoming the year during which the Cascade Orienteering Club grows into full bloom. Our meets this year have been the most well-attended in the Club's history. Important factors are better publicity, new areas close to town, detailed multicolor maps, and most importantly a larger group of enthusiastic people, including our friends from Sweden. The Club is also gaining a firmer financial footing, and will be able to afford more multi-color maps, an expanded newsletter, and more controls, punches, and rental compasses.

We are working hard with Eddie Bauer, Inc. on the events to be held in May. We will need at least a dozen people to help with registration, training, timing, and checking at the BIG Seward Park meet on May 31. If you would like to help, please contact me.

I encourage all of you to invite your friends and relations to our orienteering meets. See you there,

Dave Enger
