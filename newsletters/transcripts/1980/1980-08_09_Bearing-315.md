## T-SHIRTS

A new order of club T-shirts are in and will be available for sale at all club meets. The shirts are red with the club distinctive logo in white on the upper left (the wearer's upper left) front side. They are just like the other T-shirts that were for sale. The T-shirts are made of 50% cotton and 50% polyester. They will be available in sizes: S,M,L and XL for $5.00 to COC members and $6.00 to non-members.

## EXAMPLE OF A GREEN COURSE

## A Green Course ?
For many years throughout the USA and Canada there has been only five different levels of courses that varied in difficulty. They were: the white course for novice orienteers; yellow and orange for intermediate orienteers; red for the women's advanced and blue for the men's advanced. Although our club meets have not included all of these courses, all Class A and most Class B meets include all five levels of courses. These courses are further broken down into age categories for women and men so that anyone can compete in a category that is commensurate with their age and experience level. As orienteers progressed from white to red or blue, the courses increased in both distance and technical difficulty. There has been a growing need to have a technically challenging course that was less physically demanding. As a result, the USOF has proposed a green course be added to the current set of courses and has requested that it be included in all Class A and B meets on an experimental basis. This course is designed to be approximately the same length as the orange course but with the orienteering challenge equal to the red course. The green course is a good idea for those who want the technical challenge of a red course without the physical challenge. After all, that's what orienteering is all about - The Thinking Sport.

## From the President

After our usual summertime lull, we are embarking on an ambitious fall schedule. Our current efforts are geared toward the October 5, Class "B" Regional Meet to be held at Fort Lewis. The map is being completed and we are attempting to find a sponsor. Of course, we will appreciate any ideas and assistance offered for this meet and other events. Also, since the best advertising is by word of mouth, I encourage you to tell a friend about our club. Better yet, bring them to a meet and let them experience our fun sport first hand!
-- Dave

## Editorial Comment

What happened to the newsletter? Let me explain..... Lorrie O'Brien has been doing our newsletter in addition to being the club Secretary and doing a great job at both. But recently she has been out of town and Dave Enger was looking for someone to help do this issue when I volunteered to do the whole thing. For those who don't know me, I like orienteering and enjoy doing things like newsletters so when this newsletter started to fall together I got carried away and you are reading the outcome. Any comments, suggestions or ideas, whether good or bad, about this newsletter would be greatly appreciated. We will use the information in putting together further newsletters. What will happen to the format and content of future newsletters will depend on your input plus who will continue as editor.

In the meantime, send in your thoughts to the editor in care of the club address. Your ideas are important, so share them with us.

Yours in orienteering,
Clayton

## Canada Two-Day Meet

AUGUST 3 and 4

The two-day Class A meet at Merritt, B.C. was well worth the trip. It was a shame more members of COC could not get a day off from work to go. The drive through Canada was beautiful because you had a choice of two different routes, each displaying its own dramatic beauty. One followed a canyon cut by a river while the other went over the Cascades through mountain passes. The route selection afforded the opportunity to drive two completely different ways going up and coming back.

The meet site was even more beautiful with the camp site located on Lundbom Lake right on the edge of the orienteering map. There was a fair amount of animal life to see on the courses and no stinging plants. I was fortunate to be the first one on the course on day two and saw a number of deer and other smaller wildlife in addition to the ever present cattle grazing in the open fields. I could not help wondering what they thought of us as we raced back and forth over the open grassland.

The red and blue courses were a treat as they were designed by a Swedish orienteerer who had visited the OABC earlier in the summer when they were using the same area for a training meet. His courses were challenging and required a variety of orienteering techniques. Several of the legs on both days of the blue course were long (1.8Km and 2.1Km) which afforded the competitors many route options.

The start for both days was within 600 meters of our camp site and the courses finished within 30 meters of our tents. If you want to know about the fun we had between the start and finish, anyone of us who went (Dave Enger, Mike Schuh, Doroth and Clayton Smith) will be more than happy to trade tall tales about a great orienteering meet and some great people. Most enjoyable!!!!
