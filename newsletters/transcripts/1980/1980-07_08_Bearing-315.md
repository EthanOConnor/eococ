## From The President
Our Fun Trek 8 orienteering meet at Seward Park on May 31st was a huge success. The meet was our biggest and best organized ever, and went very smoothly. We had about 120 participants, more than twice as many as any previous meet, and all appeared to enjoy themselves. I was particularly pleased that we attracted so many people from other clubs, as you can see from the results list. I talked with many of them and we are developing more participation in other clubs' events, notably the British Columbia and Ellensburg clubs.

Much of the credit for the "Fun Trek '80" success should go to our co-sponsor, Eddie Bauer. They provided advance publicity, general organization, facilities for the clinics, map printing, insurance coverage, refreshments, and excellent prizes.

I would like to thank those club members who spent many hours working on the "Fun Trek '80" events. First of all, Len Englund, who dreamed up and initiated the program, coordinated with Eddie Bauer, Inc., and provided motivation throughout. Many thanks also to Charlie Bock for single-handedly creating the superb Seward Park map and designing and setting the four excellent courses. Tony Paulson coordinated the publicity and conducted the Discovery Park workshop. Clayton Smith conducted two of the in-store clinics, and Bo Powell conducted the lunch hour clinic and helped with training at several events.

Thanks also to Mike Schuh, who built the start and finish frames, directed the Discovery Park meet, and controlled the timing at the Seward Park meet. At the Seward Park meet, Bob Hale-Harbaugh was the starter, Jean and Bob Hendrickson handled registration, Carol Johnson, Lorrie O’Brien, Savitri Khalsa, and Debbie Newell did recording and results checking/posting. Einer Storackers and Richard Lacy performed the strenuous task of circulating around the Seward Park courses throughout the day-long meet checking control markers. In fact, Richard accomplished a new feat in orienteering, an "Orienteering Century"—he "punched in" at about 100 controls.
