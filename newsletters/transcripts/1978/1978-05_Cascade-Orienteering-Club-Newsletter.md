# CASCADE ORIENTEERING CLUB NEWSLETTER
## MAY 1978

Fellow Orienteers,

This letter is to let you know of some recent changes involving our club. First of all, elections were held at our May 8th meeting. Our new officers are as follows:

- PRESIDENT: Karl Nolte (632-5559 Seattle)
- VICE PRES: Tom Stewart (964-4309 Tacoma)
- SECRETARY: Stan Hochman (746-8028 Bellevue)
- TREASURER: Corrie Fiedler (322-9018 Seattle)

We hope to have another change in February 1979 as we grow and get more of us involved in the sport of Orienteering and the job of running the club and the meets.

We also have some changes in events since our last mailing. I hope most of us will be able to take part in at least one of the events we have scheduled for May.

### FRIDAY MAY 19:
Our first social event will be held at the

**SWEDISH CLUB**  
1920 DEXTER N.  
SEATTLE

at 7:30. We hope to see a lot of you there.

### SATURDAY MAY 20:
A training session and workshop will be held at

**SEWARD PARK**  
SEATTLE

at 10:00 AM at the picnic area at the top of the hill. Look for the control point. This activity is being held in conjunction with our big event...

### SUNDAY MAY 21:
The First Annual Lingering Lodestone and Compass Carnival near the town of

**SNOQUALMIE**

at 10:00 AM. This event is being co-sponsored by REI Co-op and will be held in an area EAST of the Snoqualmie Falls. Various courses will be set up so all levels of difficulty can be attempted. The entry fee will be $3 for members of the club and $4 for non-members. Signs will be set up to guide you to the area once you reach the Snoqualmie Falls area.

Finally, I would like to remind everyone that our next meeting will be held on June 12th at the **PUGET POWER AUDITORIUM** in BELLEVUE at 7:30. This meeting will be a business and planning session for our Summer schedule. All members are invited to attend. I realize that the sport of Orienteering is "run" outdoors, but the "running" of the club and those events which we all take part in take a lot of time and effort as well. I hope that more members will get involved and help this club to organize bigger and better meets and activities. If you cannot attend the meeting (or any meeting) but would like to talk over some idea or problem you have about the sport or club, please feel free to call one of the officers and express your opinion.

We will have another mailing next month, after the meeting, to outline our future activities. See you at the meets!
